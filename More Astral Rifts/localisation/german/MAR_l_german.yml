 # Starless Skies

 MAR_starless_rift_event.1.name: "Starless Skies"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.1.desc: "Our sphere have arrived on the surface of a planet not dissimilar to that of a regular continental world, though there is little light. In fact, the only light is that of the local flora, a type of tree with dimly glowing blue leaves, as well as the light we brought with us. The skies above are pitch black, and preliminary scans pick up no signs of photons."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.1.a: "Activate heavy scanners."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.1.b: "Sample the local flora."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.5.name: "Cavernous World"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.5.desc: "The scanners reveal that we are, in fact, not on the surface. Above us something blocks our scanner from reaching the void, waves bouncing back to us. The signal is reflected almost perfectly, revealing that the structure's surface is almost perfectly smooth. This smoothness, however, also means we don't recieve much information on the composition of the cavern roof."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.5.a: "Fly up and take a closer look."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.5.b: "Use a laser-based reckon system."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.5.c: "Sample the local flora."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.10.name: "Something's Up There"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.10.desc: "The journey upwards was beautiful, with the bioluminescent trees underneath slowly fading away, yet the distance gained also slowly turned the points of lights into a sea that seemingly stretches across the whole planet, or at least as far as we can see.\n\nOur sensors have not picked up anything from the surface, but now, as our sphere approaches the ceiling, our scanners pointed upwards start picking up... movements?"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.10.a: "Continue."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.10.b: "Go Back Down!"
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.15.name: "The Beast"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.15.desc: "The Darkness above moves, the sky itself shifting and coiling itself, with sparse dots of dim lights appearing behind it. Our scanners go haywire, showing that what we had assumed to be a cavernal structure of sorts is actually a gigantic creature, its outline now visible against the canvas of stars. A single bright point of light moves across the black creature and fixes itself like an eye on our team of explorers."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.15.a: "Observe It."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.15.b: "Leave! Leave!"
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.20.name: "Back To Safety"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.20.desc: "We quickly got to pulling back the sphere out the rift with the anchor. The beast's gutteral hissing could be heard as it chased the suddenly fleeing visitor, though [Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] team managed to get though the rift in a timely manner and without casualties."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.20.a: "Ok."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.21.name: "A Feast for the Beast."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.21.desc: "Darkness plunged forward toward the sphere, and wraps around it. The last transmission from the exploration team was that of [Leader.GetName] frantically telling us to 'Hurry up and pull us out!'. Then our signal is cut, and we manage to pull out only a severed chain."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.21.a: "$UNFORTUNATE$"
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.25.name: "Supermassive Creature"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.25.desc: "The creature watched our team for a few moments, then slithered forward.\n\n[Leader.GetName] reports that the creature is massive, almost impossibly so, though the beast appeared more curious than hostile.\n\nSuddenly our sphere's lights dimmed, though nothing is wrong with our electrical supply system."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.25.a: "Turn off the lights."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.25.b: "Reroute more power to the lights."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.30.name: "Lost Interest"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.30.desc: "The creature let out a loud noise, then after a nerve-wracking moment of intense silence on the crews part, it slithered back into the sky, once again covering it, plunging the world into darkness.\n\n[Leader.GetName] is unsure what the creature does, but is not eager to continue studies."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.30.a: "Better leave while we can."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.35.name: "Light-Eater"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.35.desc: "The creature slithered closer, wrapping darkness around our sphere. Despite the massive size, it carefully cradles our sphere with its wings.\n\nThis close, we can determine that the light is not reflected upon its hide, and [Leader.GetName] sumises that the creature absorbs light and converts it into energy, hence its interest in our sphere."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.35.a: "Scan the composition of its hide."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.40.name: "The Darkest Dark"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.40.desc: "Initial scans show that the creature's hide, as suspected, absorb light. More specifically, it not only absorbs all wavelengths in the visible spectrum, it absorbs ALL wavelengths, making it perfect for hiding from photon-based reflection scanners.\n\nReplicating its structure with artificial materials should allows us to enhance our cloaking capabilities."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.40.a: "Excellent."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.50.name: "Lack of Reflection"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.50.desc: "Despite the initial scans showing us to be in a cavern-like structure, the laser is not reflected by the ceiling.\n\n[Leader.GetName] suggest the sphere's scanners may not be working, or perhaps the underlying rules of physics of this universe may not work in the same way as our own."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.50.a: "Fly up and take a closer look."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.50.b: "Set the laser to maximum intensity."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.55.name: "A Living Roof"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.55.desc: "At first nothing happens, then the darkness is slowly burned away, making way for bright light that leaks out of the roof. It looks like it is liquid light. Then our scanners pick up movements from the ceiling.\n\nIn conjuction with this, a loud screech is heard and the sky moves, easily observable due to the liquid light leaking out.\n\nThe roof - no, creature moves and our scanners show that it is moving towards our sphere."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.55.a: "Pull the anchor!"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.55.b: "Continue to use the laser."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.65.name: "The Fall"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.65.desc: "More liquid light started leaking out as the creature descended, new wounds opening up. The creature tumbled down, the enourmous body making way for the star-filled sky behind it. With a ear-splitting screech the creature tumbled down to the ground. The forest around us is crushed, and the earth shook upon the impact"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.65.a: "Sample its blood."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.65.b: "Cut off its head."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.66.name: "Loss"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.66.desc: "The creature descended upon our sphere and enveloped it in darkness.\n\nA few jumbled words that were suddenly and abruptly cut off were transmitted back through the rift.\n\nWe have recieved no further communications from our sphere, and [Leader.GetName] is assumed to have been killed in action."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.66.a: "May [Leader.GetHeShe] rest in peace."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.name: "Shining Blood"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.desc: "After throughout analysis, [Leader.GetName] has determined the blood's bioluminescent properties to be linked to a specific gene appended to the end of the creature's DNA. It's nothing much impressive beyond the apparent brightness of it and the fact that it appears to be compatible with our own.\n\nReplication should be possible, and will allow for use in the medical industry with some interesting cosmetic effects."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.a: "Let's splice it into our DNA!"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.b: "Let's just hold onto it for now."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.a.tooltip: "Unlocks the $trait_MAR_lightblood$ trait.\nModify the [Explorer.GetSpeciesName] species with the $trait_MAR_lightblood$ trait."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.70.b.tooltip: "Unlocks the $trait_MAR_lightblood$ trait."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.75.name: "Glory Ahead"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.75.desc: "It took some searching, but [Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] team finally found the best cutoff locations to take off its head.\n\nThey then used the inbuilt excavation tools in the sphere to cut it off.\n\nIt has a single dull eye which glows faintly in the dark, even now, though the scales are unobservable, as they appear to absorb all known wavelengths of light.\n\nIt will now serve as a reminder of the strength of the [Explorer.GetName]."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.75.a: "Good."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.80.name: "Reacting To The Light"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.80.desc: "Our initial examinations and test revealed that the trees leaves react to light, such as the ones they themselves emit, though after a few attempts with different types of wavelengths, we have determined the biggest reactions come from those where we imitate wavelengths from distant stars, which is surprising considering the lack of stars.\n\n[leader.GetName] has theorized that red- or blue-shifting the wavelengths could provide better results."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.80.a: "Use Red-shfited wavelengths."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.80.b: "Use Blue-shifted wavelengths."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.81.name: "Snuffed Lights"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.81.desc: "At first the leaves started uncurling, revealing themselves to actually be stalks, with hidden leaves unfurling and becoming fronds.\n\nHowever, after a very short time they began crumbling before out very eyes.\n\nThen the tree seemed to enter an inert stage where the bioluminescent leaves ceased to emit any light.\nAny nearby trees also began this process plunging the world into even more darkness than it was. One of our team described it almost like a 'city running out of power and shutting down'.\n\n[Leader.GetName] sumises it is a defense mechanism to avoid contamination of the whole forest. While interesting, this unfortunately concludes our studies."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.81.a: "Ok."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.85.name: "Lightbloom"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.85.desc: "When shining red-shifted wavelengths on the leaves, they immediately began to glow more brightly with small flowers blooming at the end of every branch.\n\nThe whole forest quickly became almost as bright as day.\n\n[Leader.GetName] suspects that some event on this planet involving red-shifted light happens regularly, which would then trigger the blooming, and subsequently dispersal of seeds."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.85.a: "Sample the flowers."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.85.b: "Observe the flowers."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.90.name: "Seeds of Light"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.90.desc: "The flowers we have sampled quickly lost their brightness, though a faint glow from within reveals the leaves act as the trees means to spread: Inside each leaf is a tiny seed, its leaves perfect for being snatched on the wind and carried away so that a new tree can take root far away.\n\n[Leader.GetName] has collected some of these seeds, which will allow us to plant our trees own back home."
 MAR_starless_rift_event.90.a: "Splendid!"
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.90.a.tooltip: "Unlocks the $MAR_plant_lighttrees$ decision."
 
 MAR_starless_rift_event.95.name: "Life's So Short"
 MAR_starless_rift_event.95.desc: "The flowers continued to shine until the leaves fell off. Where they landed, they continue to shine for some time, though ultimately the light faded.\n\n[Leader.GetName] says that the observation has inspired [Leader.GetHimHer] to live life while [Leader.GetHimHer] can, and has now returned with a new appreciation for existence."

 MAR_clockstopper_rift_event.10.desc.1: "We observed the sand as it slowly ran out.\n\nThen, when it was almost there, metal against metal screeched as something scraped against each other.\n\nA mechanism underneath the altar slowly began moving the hourglass upwards into the air and metallic mechanical arms were extened from hidden compartments in the wall, and attached to its sides while simultaniously unattaching it from the altar. Then, unbelievably fast, the hourglass was flipped on its head and reattached to the altar.\n\nIt then continued to run out of time as if nothing had ever happened."
