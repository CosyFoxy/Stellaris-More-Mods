The Valley:

Currently: Choose between Huts or finding the Dome.
Dome: Outside the Dome was nothing. Air gets sucked out if drilling through the dome, leaving the space in vaccum.
Huts: Find Emergency Shelter with much Food plus document stating expansion past emergency zone is not intended
Ideas:
If new empire:
- If drilling through the dome:
    Find a barren land with nothing but cold stone. Primitive buildings can be seen in the distance, yet first
    indications show that this area does not support life.
    Interestingly, most of our scans returned as if hitting some sort of wall, although they appear warped and corrupted.
    Except one direction, in which our scan did not return. What does this mean.
        - Search the buildings for life forms
            The buildings seem to indicate that previously this area has been inhabited. We find the cellar with the intact food supplies
                Peculiar
        - Find out why one scan did not return
            We find what appears to be a crystalline dome. At the point at which our scan received no data, we found a hole
            seemingly created by some sort of drilling device.
            It has barely reached the outside, but no further attempt at penetrating the dome is detected
                Go back to buildings
                Exit the dome
                    Outside the dome is a vast space. Or rather a vast nothingness. It appears as if the dome was not a dome,
                    but a sphere. A sphere drifting in an ocean of emptiness. We have more questions than answers
                        Analyze the dome
                            >End
                        Wander further
                            We cannot say how long we have been venturing into the vast nothingness. Occassionally we were able to spot tiny sparks in the distance
                            only for them to dissapear when we wanted to get closer. After another seeming eternity of drifting,
                            we find another sphere. Many holes have penetrated the sphere, and the inside seem as lifeless as our first one.
                            From outside, we can see ruins of more primitive buildings, however seemingly more than we saw in our first sphere.
                            Whatever this is, so far all we have found was death and collapse
                                Leave the rift.

- If taking the food:
    Start out as original rift. When going towards the huts, find nothing of interest. Whatever lived here has long died. Give negative trait
    If going to dome, repeat original rift


New ideas:
    The Labyrinth
        - Scientist finds themselves in what appears to be a hallway, torches lighting up the pathway
            - Go to the left or right
            - Correct route: Left Left Right Left
            - Options to go left/right/leave on each step
            - A loud thumping noise comes closer for every step
            - If final room is not reached in 5 steps, the scientist is killed by whatever made the noise
            - Final room has a reward, resources? empire modifier?
        - On second explore:
            - Same empire (only if not priorly finished)
                - Can attempt again etc
            - New empire (only if not priorly finished)
                - Can attempt as well
